# esther

Esther consumes the [quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable)

## Directions

1. Make sure you have [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed on your machine (or if you feel lazy execute the `install.sh` file and skip to 3 or 4)
2. Set [twurl](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) up
3. Give Esther executable permissions: `chmod +x esther.sh`
4. You're good to go, setup a cron to execute esther
